#Steps to run my project:
My project can do multiplication,division,addition and subtraction of two 8 bit binary numbers can  give answers in hexadecimal on seven segment display.

1.Open logism.

2.Navigate to the main section.

3.INPUT any two 8 bit numbers A and B

4.For selecting the operation:
  for ADDITION: s0=0,s1=0
  for SUBTRACTION:s0=0,s1=1
  for MULTIPLICATION:s0=1,s1=0
  for DIVISION:s0=1,s1=1

5.16 digit binary result will be shown in hexadecimal format by using 4 seven segment displays.

NOTE:for subtraction,if the answer is negative then it will be displayed in 2's compliment form and borrow bit will indicate zero.

#Set of input combinations:
 1.Addition: A=10101010(170) + B=10001111(143) 
 2.Subtraction (case 1): A=10010010(146) - B=00000011(3)
 3.Multiplication      : A=00001111(15) X B=00000111(7)
 4.Division            : A=00011000(24) / B=00000011(3) (Quotient)
